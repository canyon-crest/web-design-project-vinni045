My family and I like to sit on the small hills in the bright sun and have a picnic while watching the backwaters. My sister always brings her bicycle to ride around, and sometimes I roller skate beside her. On some nights, we can even see fireworks from SeaWorld since it's close by.</p>
    <h3>Favorite Place</h3>
    <p><img src='images/alaska2025.jpg'>My favorite place I've visited for vacation is Alaska, which I went to this past summer. Some of the cities I visited were Anchorage, Denali, Healy, Whittier, Seward, and more. I rode a train for a scenic ride, went on two cruises, and even got to do a helicopter ride over the <a href = 'https://www.google.com/search?q=knik+glacier&sca_esv=e43c86de5287e939&rlz=1CAWOAL_enUS1173&ei=GLHuaNbXKcPTkPIPuJKusAg&ved=0ahUKEwjWw5uuwqSQAxXDKUQIHTiJC4YQ4dUDCBE&uact=5&oq=knik+glacier&gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiDGtuaWsgZ2xhY2llcjIFEC4YgAQyCxAuGIAEGMcBGK8BMgUQABiABDIFEAAYgAQyBRAAGIAEMgUQABiABDIFEAAYgAQyBRAAGIAEMhEQLhiABBjHARiYBRiZBRivATIFEAAYgAQyFBAuGIAEGJcFGNwEGN4EGOAE2AEBSNYHUIMCWPEGcAJ4AZABAJgBiAGgAY8FqgEDMi40uAEDyAEA-AEBmAIIoALfBsICChAAGLADGNYEGEfCAg4QABiwAxjkAhjWBNgBAcICExAuGIAEGLADGEMYyAMYigXYAQGYAwCIBgGQBgy6BgYIARABGAmSBwMyLjagB5dQsgcDMC42uAeZBsIHBTMtMy41yAezAQ&sclient=gws-wiz-serp&surl=1&safe=active&ssui=on' target = '_blank'>Knik River and Glacier</a>. From the train, we saw beautiful nature all around us, and on the cruise, we spotted humpback whales, puffins, sea lions, otters, and seals. I also got to see different kinds of glaciers, like tidewater glaciers, valley glaciers, and hanging glaciers. After the helicopter ride, I even got to walk on a glacier and drink its water. It was an unforgettable experience.</p>
    <h3>My Hobbies</h3>
    <p><img src='images/kindle.jpg'>I like to read books in my free time. I prefer physical books over digital ones, but since they take up a lot of space, I've been reading more e-books lately. Because of school, I haven't had much time to read, but I wish I could read a little every day since I find it relaxing, and it relieves stress. I also love watching TV shows with my mom, like <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gilmore+girls&rlz=1CAWOAL_enUS1173&oq=gilmore+girls&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTINCAEQABiDARixAxiABDINCAIQABiDARixAxiABDINCAMQABiDARixAxiABDIHCAQQABiABDIHCAUQABiABDINCAYQABiDARixAxiABDIKCAcQABixAxiABDIHCAgQABiABDIHCAkQABiPAtIBCDMxMjdqMGo3qAIAsAIA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&surl=1&safe=active&ssui=on" target="_blank">Gilmore Girls</a>, Friends, Lost in Space, and different baking shows. Spending time reading or watching shows helps me unwind and relax. </p>
